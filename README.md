A Timesheet Management System is a digital solution designed to help organizations record, track, and manage employee work hours efficiently. It allows employees to log the time they spend on daily tasks or projects, while providing managers with tools to review, approve, and analyze these entries for productivity, billing, or payroll purposes.

The system streamlines traditional manual timekeeping methods, reduces errors, and improves transparency across teams. It typically includes features such as daily/weekly timesheet entries, project-based time tracking, approval workflows, reporting tools, and integration with payroll or HR systems.

By implementing a Timesheet Management System, companies can ensure accurate time tracking, optimize resource allocation, enhance accountability, and support better decision-making based on real-time data.
